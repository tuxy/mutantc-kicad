# mutantC-kicad
(attempted) remake of the mutantC v4 on KiCAD

Right now:
- The main pcb is incomplete
- The thumbstick pcb is partially complete
	- All of the functionality is done, I just need to position everything correctly
- The display PCB is complete (Components are different and also positioned differently, but should still work flawlessly?)
